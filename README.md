# AirBnB Clone

The AirBnB Clone project is a part of the higher-level software engineering curriculum. The purpose of this project is to create a clone of the popular AirBnB website and implement basic features such as user authentication, property listings, booking, and reviews. The goal is to understand how web applications are structured and develop skills in object-oriented programming and system design.

## Command Interpreter

This project also includes the development of a simple command-line interpreter that mimics the behavior of the AirBnB website. The interpreter allows users to interact with the application, creating, editing, and viewing objects related to the AirBnB platform.

### How to Start the Interpreter

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
